# Android Checklist

### Preparation

- create or get an existing test account ready


### Notes
compied from the android repo, needs to be rweritten.

Only some rough ideas, ideally, this should result into a simple checklist that can be checked before releasing. However, although it would be nice to test "everything", we should keep in mind that the test should be doable in, say, 10~15 minutes.

    create new account with (one of?): gmail, yandex, other or (?) test an existing account
    send and receive a message
    create a group
    do a contact verification
    join a group via a qr scan
